## Motivation
I wanted to create a simple startup based e-commernce application so I decided to create one. Some insparation come from [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/).the best of React's ecosystem and current web development's best practices for frontend part and node/express 
is backend part.

So, I used some cutting edge technology such as [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), 
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) so many other tech.
